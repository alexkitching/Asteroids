# Asteroids Recreation

**1st Year University Project** <br/>

This was my very first finished game project I produced at university.

I was tasked with Recreating a Retro Arcade Game and I decided to choose asteroids.

Compared to my Later Projects this isn't my best work however it was where I started and is a useful comparison to see how I've developed my skills especially when looking at my seconds assignment Tiny Tanks.
